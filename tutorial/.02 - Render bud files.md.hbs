The most powerful feature of {{pkg.name}} is rendering files from files.

First you prepare a `.bud` file.
A bud contains file meta data like witch template to use, where to render it, what permission to give, and so on.

```javascript
{@lang javascript}{{{read '../examples/01-minimum-demo/.who-likes-what.txt.bud'}}}
```
